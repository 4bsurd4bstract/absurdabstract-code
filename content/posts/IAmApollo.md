This was originally created for an 8 channel speaker array.
The concept was that each pulsating sound would rotate around the listeners head at a rate proportional to the orbit of a planet. The pulsing was proportional to the planets day length. 

The sound of the planets was decided without much thought, so one day I would like to rerecord this piece with something other than garbage-sounding midi-instruments. The only sounds I do appreciate are sonified data from several planets, which I took from NASA's website.

This version was decoded into binaural, so headphones are recommended for the best listening experience.
