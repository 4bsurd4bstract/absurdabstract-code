If you think that this looks like four controllers duct taped togeather, you would be right. 
I've been experimenting with this interface for the control of computer synthesizers (such as VCV rack patches) and it's been quite a bit of fun. 

My favorite quality of this interface is that there is equal capacity for solo and collaberative performance due to the excess of buttons and joysticks. There is no way to accurately control every aspect of these programs all at once which can result in some very surprising and stimulating sonic landscapes.

This is an ongoing project, and will most likely end up coding something custom for this interface to control sound and visuals simultaneously.
